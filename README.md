# Contact App

The frontend of this app was develop in React with the use of Node.js. This time the installation is way simpler, just use the following commands:

```
cd frontEnd
npm i
npm run dev
```

An .env.example file is included in this project, just add the url of the backend running into the VITE_APIURL variable without any aditional endpoint and rename the file to .env.

```
VITE_APIURL=http://domain:port
```
